"{\"abstract\":\"Improving maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) outcomes is a critical target for global sustainable development. Our research is centered on building predictive models, evaluating their interpretability, and generating actionable insights about the markers (features) and triggers (events) associated with vulnerability in MNCH. In this work, we demonstrate how a tool for inspecting \\u201cblack box\\u201d machine learning models can be used to generate actionable insights from models trained on demographic health survey data to predict neonatal mortality. 1 Evaluating Vulnerability in MNCH Improving maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) outcomes is an important health priority for sustainable global development. However, the progress towards MNCH-specific global targets such as reducing the maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and lowering preventable deaths among newborns and children by the year 2030 remains uneven across countries 1. Some of the key barriers to understanding and addressing MNCH challenges are the complicated interactions of various factors and interventions captured in data, including those stemming from existing MNCH-related efforts. Furthermore, due to the limitations of traditional statistical analysis approaches, it is difficult to generate new insights from data without the innovative use of machine learning algorithms. However, although machine learning algorithms are good at prediction, they are often considered \\u201cblack box\\u201d models for their lack of interpretability. Consequently, MNCH stakeholders and policymakers find it difficult to adopt machine learning models for decision-making and intervention planning. It is plausible that certain subpopulations of mothers and children have an increased susceptibility to shocks in their environment (biological or socio-economic vulnerabilities) that predispose them to disproportionately worse health outcomes such as neonatal and maternal mortality. Our goal is to help MNCH domain experts and stakeholders study, understand, https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2019/ and identify these subpopulations. Towards this goal, we are developing predictive machine learning models to identify factors that contribute to poor MNCH health outcomes, and importantly, are using an interactive visual analytics tool, Prospector, to inspect these \\u201cblack box\\u201d models and generate actionable insights. These insights could be used by MNCH stakeholders for planning targeted interventions for vulnerable subpopulations. 2 Prospector for Inspecting Black Box Models Prospector is a visual analytics and explainability tool to inspect \\u201cblack box\\u201d models [Krause et al., 2016]. A data scientist can upload any predictive model into Prospector and then visualize feature importance rankings and partial dependence plots, as well as conduct localized inspection interactively. Feature importance is a measure of how important a feature is (relative to other markers in the model) in predicting the outcome. Partial dependence plots [Friedman, 2001] illustrate how, on average, varying the value of a given feature affects the predicted outcome while holding all other features constant. Localized inspection generates counterfactual data to illustrate how changing the feature profile of an individual subject affects the relationship between a single feature and the outcome for that individual. One of our goals for using Prospector is to enable insight generation by MNCH domain experts and stakeholders. For example, using the enhanced capabilities of Prospector, MNCH experts can visualize, interact, and reason about what features are important for targeted intervention planning. We believe this to be the first practical real-world use of Prospector. 3 Inspection of Neonatal Mortality Models Trained on Demographic Health Survey Data To demonstrate how Prospector can be used to generate MNCH insights, we analyzed Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)2 data from 10 Sub-Saharan countries. DHS data are generated from a series of household surveys conducted in over 90 countries every 3 to 5 years. These surveys are nationally representative and are primarily used for collecting data https://www.dhsprogram.com/ Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-20) Demonstrations Track\",\"arxivId\":null,\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":\"1423725451\",\"name\":\"W.
